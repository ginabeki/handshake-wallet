### Sarah's Story: From Local Seller to Global Entrepreneur

Meet Sarah, a talented artisan from Kenya who crafts unique, handmade jewelry. Previously limited to her local market, Sarah's world changes when she discovers HandShake Wallet.

1. **Global Marketplace Access**: 
   Sarah easily creates listings for her jewelry on HandShake Wallet, showcasing her creations to a worldwide audience.

   John, an art enthusiast in the United States, stumbles upon Sarah's exquisite necklace while browsing HandShake Wallet's global marketplace.

3. **Seamless Communication**: 
   Intrigued, John initiates a chat with Sarah directly through the platform, discussing the necklace's details and customization options.

4. **Frictionless Payment**: 
   Once they agree on the purchase, John uses HandShake Wallet to send payment in USD. Behind the scenes, tbDEX protocol springs into action:

   - It finds the best exchange rate for converting USD to Kes (Kenyan Shilling).
   - The conversion is executed swiftly and securely.

5. **Secure Transaction Holding**: 
   HandShake Wallet securely holds the converted funds, assuring Sarah of the payment and John of his purchase protection.

6. **Efficient Delivery**: 
   Sarah drops off the necklace at a local HandShake Wallet pickup point, initiating the tracked delivery process to John in the US.

7. **Confirmation and Release**: 
   Upon receiving the necklace, John confirms his satisfaction through the app. HandShake Wallet immediately releases the held funds to Sarah's wallet in GHS.

8. **Beyond the Sale**: 
   With earnings in her HandShake Wallet, Sarah now has options:
   - Reinvest in her business by purchasing supplies from international vendors.
   - Transfer money to her family in Kenya, again utilizing tbDEX for optimal GHS to KES conversion.
   - Save in her preferred currency or even explore cryptocurrency options, all within the same platform.
